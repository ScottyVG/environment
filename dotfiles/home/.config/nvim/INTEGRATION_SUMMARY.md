# TJ DeVries Integration Summary

## What Was Added

### Enhanced Settings (`set.lua`)
- **Smart search**: `smartcase` and `ignorecase` for better search behavior
- **Live substitution**: `inccommand = "split"` shows replacements in real-time

- **System clipboard**: `clipboard = "unnamedplus"` for seamless copy/paste
- **Format options**: Removed auto-comment on 'o' command

### Improved Keymaps (`remap.lua`)
- **Execute Lua**: `<leader>x` runs current line, `<leader><leader>x` runs file
- **Smart Enter**: `<CR>` clears search highlight or acts as normal enter
- **Better diagnostics**: `]d` and `[d` for next/previous diagnostic with descriptions
- **Window navigation**: Simplified to normal mode only for better compatibility

   - `mason-tool-installer.nvim`: Auto-install development tools

2. **Conform.nvim**: Better code formatting
   - Supports multiple formatters per filetype
   - Format on save capability
   - Fallback to LSP formatting

3. **Oil.nvim**: Enhanced file management
   - Edit directories like buffers
   - Better than default netrw

4. **Mini.nvim**: Collection of useful utilities
   - `mini.ai`: Enhanced text objects
   - `mini.surround`: Surround operations (add/delete/change quotes, brackets, etc.)

5. **Fidget.nvim**: LSP progress indicators
   - Shows LSP server status
   - Progress notifications for long operations

6. **Enhanced completion**: Added path and buffer completion sources

### Updated Configurations

## New Keymaps Reference

### File Management
- `-`: Open parent directory with Oil
- `<space>-`: Open parent directory in floating window

### Code Execution

## Development Workflow Improvements

### 1. Better LSP Management
- Mason automatically installs and manages language servers
- No more manual LSP server installation
- Consistent formatting across all languages

### 2. Enhanced File Navigation
- Oil.nvim provides a much better file editing experience
- Harpoon v2 for quick project file access
- Better Telescope integration for finding anything

### 3. Improved Code Editing
- Mini.nvim text objects for better text manipulation
- Conform.nvim for consistent code formatting
- Better completion with multiple sources

### 4. Quality of Life
- Live substitution preview
- Smart search behavior
- LSP progress indicators
- Better split behavior

## Next Steps

1. **Install plugins**: Run `:PackerSync` in Neovim
2. **Install tools**: Mason will auto-install LSP servers and formatters
3. **Learn new keymaps**: Practice the new shortcuts
4. **Customize further**: Add language-specific configurations as needed

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- New features are additive, not replacing
- Keymaps are documented for easy reference
- Configuration is well-commented for future modifications

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Run `:PackerSync` to ensure all plugins are installed
2. Run `:Mason` to check LSP server installation status
3. Run `:checkhealth` to diagnose any problems
4. Check the configuration guide for detailed explanations
